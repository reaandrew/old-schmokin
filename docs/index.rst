Schmokin
========

A wrapper for curl providing chainable assertions to create simple but powerful smoke tests all written in bash

Look how easy it is to use:

    ./schmokin $URL --jq '.status' --eq "UP"

Look how it proxies all curl arguments... to curl!

    ./schmokin $URL --req-header "X-FU" --eq 'BAR' -- -H "X-FU: BAR"
